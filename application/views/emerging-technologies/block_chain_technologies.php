                       An ingenious invention, a digital ledger, a booming and in-demand technology- Block-chain. In the most simplest words, a blockchain is a time-stamped series of rigid transaction data that is recorded and managed by a group of computers. The blockchain technology is a simple and efficient way of transporting information from one point to other.

                      <li><b>Decentralization : </b> All the data is stored in multiple nodes, instead of one central server, making it almost
impossible to lose the data, or any kind of unauthorized alteration. This also deletes the
need of any third party involvement.</li>
                      <li><b>Transparency : </b> Every transaction is recorded in a distributed ledger, accessible to all owners through a
key. Alterations can be made only through consensus. This makes the data recorded in
blockchain accurate, consistent, and transparent.</li>
                      <li><b>Security : </b> Since the data is recorded on decentralized ledgers, with all transactions encrypted with
a code that connects it to previous transactions, fraud and hacking becomes almost
impossible.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Traceability : </b> Every transactional entry gets a code that is attached to all the previous transaction
entries, making tracing extremely easy. Supply chain benefits the most from this
functionality.</li>
                      <li><b>Efficiency and speed : </b>A physical paper enabled ledger is a time-consuming method of recording as well as
accessing data. It also adds the aspect of possible human error. Streamlining and
automating these processes on blockchain increases speed and efficiency, and hence
productivity.</li>
                        <li><b>Cost cutting : </b>An obvious need of any organization, blockchain removes the need of third-party costs
and enables tech based trust because it is a fool-proof method, with use cases for most
business models.</li>
