                      <li><b>New features : </b> One unique provision of deep learning technology is its ability to create new features
from a set of features already located in the training dataset. Basically, it can create new
tasks to create new ones.</li>
                      <li><b>Advanced analysis : </b> Resulting from its advanced processing models, deep learning technology generates
actionable results by supporting learning techniques that keep on becoming smarter and
more efficient without human involvement. This feature enables concise and trustworthy
analysis.</li>
                      <li><b>Requires less data and computing power : </b>Even though the system is designed to consistently analyze data, the training does not
require millions of units of input, it does the job in mere hundreds of input units stored
locally. This means that minimal computing resources are invested in the deployment
making it faster, as well as affordable.</li>
